\section{Executive Summary}
\par This whitepaper evaluates the security classification of the 
AeroTech X9 drone system using established federal guidelines. 
Originally designed for commercial applications, the X9 is now 
being upgraded to meet military-grade specifications for defense 
use. This transition introduces heightened security requirements 
due to its enhanced surveillance, intelligence-gathering, and 
operational capabilities. By analyzing the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of its data, this document assigns 
a security classification to guide risk management and compliance 
measures.

\section{Introduction}
\par The upgrade of the AeroTech X9 drone from commercial to military 
use introduces new and enhanced information systems that require proper 
categorization and vulnerability analysis. Furthermore, existing systems 
from the commercial iteration must be reevaluated, as they could interact 
with new features in unexpected ways, potentially creating security risks. 

\section{Purpose}
\par The purpose of this whitepaper is to evaluate and assign a security 
classification to the AeroTech X9 drone system based on its transition 
from commercial to military-grade use. This classification will guide 
risk management strategies and compliance with relevant security 
frameworks, ensuring secure operations in defense environments.

\section{Conclusion}
\par The transition of the AeroTech X9 from commercial to military use 
necessitates a thorough reassessment of its security classification. 
With its enhanced capabilities, the system faces new threats that require 
stringent risk management measures. As the AeroTech X9 continues to evolve, 
continuous evaluation and improvement of security protocols will be 
necessary to address emerging threats and maintain operational readiness.
