\section{Executive Summary}
\par This whitepaper evaluates the security classification of the 
AeroTech X9 drone system using established federal guidelines. 
Originally designed for commercial applications, the X9 is now 
being upgraded to meet military-grade specifications for defense 
use. This transition introduces heightened security requirements 
due to its enhanced surveillance, intelligence-gathering, and 
operational capabilities. By analyzing the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of its data, this document assigns 
a security classification to guide risk management and compliance 
measures.

\section{Introduction}
\par The upgrade of the AeroTech X9 drone from commercial to military 
use introduces new and enhanced information systems that require proper 
categorization and vulnerability analysis. Furthermore, existing systems 
from the commercial iteration must be reevaluated, as they could interact 
with new features in unexpected ways, potentially creating security risks. 

\section{Purpose}
\par The purpose of this whitepaper is to evaluate and assign a security 
classification to the AeroTech X9 drone system based on its transition 
from commercial to military-grade use. This classification will guide 
risk management strategies and compliance with relevant security 
frameworks, ensuring secure operations in defense environments.

\section{Security Categorization}

\subsection{Reference Standards}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FIPS 199: Security categorization for federal systems.
    \item NIST SP 800-60: Mapping security categories to information types.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Management \& Compliance}

Alignment with Risk Management Framework (RMF) per NIST SP 800-37. Categorization informs security control selection (NIST SP 800-53). Ongoing assessment and mitigation per FIPS 200 minimum security controls.
