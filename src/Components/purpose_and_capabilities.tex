In rural areas, Aerotech drones have provided assistance to many users in the commercial sector since 2008, and the X9 will only improve upon the services previous versions provided. Farming with the X9 becomes a considerably more precise operation. The X9 can be fitted with multi-spectral and thermal sensors to monitor crop health, optimize resource use by identifying areas needing irrigation or fertilization improving yields and reducing cost. Automated drones flights can survey large fields of crops identifying pests and plant disease much earlier than traditional methods minimizing crop damage. 
In more urban areas, the Aerotech X9 will be used for building, bridge, powerlines, and other critical infrastructure inspections, and the remote monitoring of difficult to reach places like the tops of electrical towers to minimize expensive manual inspections. The X9 will be used for forest health and wildlife monitoring, pollution detection, rapid and efficient delivery in cities, and remote deliveries to locations within rough terrain areas. The capabilities of the X9 in commercial indistries is limited only by the imagination of the user.
