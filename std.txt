These are various standards and guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) related to information security, risk management, and categorization of federal information systems. Here's what each of them covers:

NIST FIPS 199 (Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199) â€“ Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems

Defines how federal agencies categorize information and information systems based on their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
Establishes three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High.
NIST FIPS 200 (Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems)

Specifies the minimum security requirements that federal agencies must follow.
Requires agencies to apply security controls from NIST SP 800-53 based on system categorization (per FIPS 199).
NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 (Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations)

Provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for federal systems.
Covers risk management, continuous monitoring, and security controls categorized by impact levels.
Used as the basis for implementing FIPS 200 security requirements.
NIST SP 800-60 Revision 2, Initial Working Draft (Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories)

Provides guidance on mapping types of information and information systems to security impact levels.
Helps agencies apply FIPS 199 for proper system categorization.
NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)

Provides a structured approach for conducting risk assessments.
Supports risk-based decision-making for security planning and compliance.
NIST SP 800-60 Volume 1 Revision 1 (Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories)

Works with FIPS 199 to help organizations identify and categorize their information and systems.
Focuses on mapping information types to security impact levels.
Summary
These standards and publications help federal agencies and organizations classify, protect, and manage risks for their information systems. FIPS 199 and 200 set the foundation, while NIST SP 800-53, 800-30, and 800-60 provide detailed implementation guidance.
